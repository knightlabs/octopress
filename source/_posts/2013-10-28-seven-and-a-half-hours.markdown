If you _do_ have to spend a full day flying back from London with a two-year old, Upper Class on Virgin Atlantic doesn't hurt; having the direct mobile of Aziz, the driver who took care of us not twice but three times over the course of the week, shuttling five bags, a car seat and a stroller around London traffic is even better. And scheduling your checkin through the Upper Class Wing of T3 at Heathrow, through which you have to pass through a pair of retractable stanchions that allow only a single car at a time to access is just surreally excellent.
